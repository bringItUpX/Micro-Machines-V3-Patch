# Micro-Machines-V3-Patch

Patch for slowing down the speed of the game Micro Machines V3 on modern Windows / Linux (wine) computers. This game was produced by Codemasters.

Run this script with "python3 patch_micro_exe_german.py" (if you have installed the german version of the game).

Run this script with "python3 patch_micro_exe_all_languages.py" (if you have installed any language version of the game).


The executable of the game has to be in the same directory like the python script. Please make a backup of the game before you run the script. The executable of the MMV3 game which is patched is micro.exe . The executable should from the date 12. May 1998 (Perhaps other dates works also, but then you need the all_languages script version). A verifying is running in the python script before running the patch, but there is no backup made.

If the patch script runs successfully, copy the file micro.exe back to your game directory (don't overwrite your backup of the orginal file), and start the game normally (you should choose perhaps Software Rendered in the start menu of Windows).

In the game, when all players are on the road and the light is green (all players can move theire cars) then press the key F7 to more slow down the game and to increase the screen resolution.

Through the patch you can play the game like in the old times with a Intel Pentium I processor at 120MHz Clock (on Windows 95/98/ME). I think on nowadays PC's with Windows 10 a better used screen (really full screen) is made only when you run this game on Linux with Wine. But it's not easy to configure, because you have to enable Win32 mode before you create the .wine directory (in the home folder), and you have to set full screen. I used this game with Wine 4.0.2 on Linux Mint 19. But also other versions should work. The .wine folder is normally created in WinWoW (Win64) mode automatically then you start wine first and if there is no .wine dirctory in your home folder.

You can play the game with 6 Usb controllers and 2 players at the keyboard - therefore a maximum of 8 players (better as in the old days with Windows 95 with difficult or no USB and only one Sound card with one game port for a controller). Then you don't have the amount of usb controllers you want, then you can configure the game (before starting the game) for seperating one game controller for two different players. You could also split two game controllers. But I haven't tried this now. I think the executable for configuring the game controllers before starting the game was: mm3joy.exe .

Sometimes under Windows 98/ME the game crashed after perhaps 2 hours of playing. With Windows 95, this was not the case, there it runs without problems. Also as I played the game in 2020 on a Linux PC with Wine 4.0.2 (in Win32 mode not Win64 !) there are no problems - but yeah - you have now Usb.

With the key F10 you can exit the game.
